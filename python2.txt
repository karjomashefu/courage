STATIC FILES IN DJANGO 
->CREATE a folder wer you put all you static files eg images,js,pluggins and sytles
for you django to know were to look for those files we have to specify the path of the files in setting.py


# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/static-files/
STATIC_URL = 'static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'assets')
->pass the command to create the folder to collect all the files from the static folder=>python manage.py colectstatic

 so for our variable we create aclass under models then put variables under that class eg
from django.db import models

>>>Create your models here.
class Destination:  # simple model to declare variable 
    id : int 
    title : st

>>>the goes to the views.py import model then create an object

def index(request):
 now object as many as you want eg
dest1 = Destination()-> is the name of a classs that is were you ar now able to put data ibn varibale u create in models 
dest1.name = "courage"

dest2 = Destination()
dest2.name= "trevor"

then after done creating u object
   #if you have more than 2 objects you create a list of the eg
  >dests = [dest1,dest2,dest3] # this i an array of object
  > return render(request,'index.html',{'dests':dests})

>>>the index.html home page 
use a for loop inorder for ur object to viewed that is to make it dynamic 
take not @# we dont pass jinja inside jinja wen dealing with pictures
>>>> check talisko video ar 1:36:51 to 1:45 
     {% load static "images" as baseUrl%}

inside will erite {{basUrl}}/{{dest.img}} #way to avoid jinja inside jinja

>>if statement in django on video 1.42
{%if dest.offer %}<p class="text-primary fw-medium">
<i class="fa fa-check text-success me-2"></i>Customer Satisfaction</p>
   {% endif %}
